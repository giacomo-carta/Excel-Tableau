# Excel-Tableau: The Wealth of Nations

Welcome to my project repository where I explore "The Wealth of Nations" public dataset using Excel and Tableau.

## About the Dataset

The "The Wealth of Nations" dataset contains information about country GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth and smartphone usage.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau

## Project Overview

In this project, I used Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, preprocessing, and conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Then, I imported the refined dataset into Tableau to identify trends and perform further analytical tasks.

## Repository Structure
- The file "The_Wealth_of_Nations_Dataset.xlsx" contains the dataset with all information about GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth and smartphone usage of all world's territories.

- The file "Project_Dashboard.twbx" contains the dashboard made using the Tableau software for data visualization.

- The file "GC_Project_Steps&Reflections.pdf" is the project outcome with a detailed, step-by-step display of the processes and the theory behind the choices taken during the analysis of the dataset.
